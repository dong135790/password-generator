# password-generator

## Description 

This website's main function is to generate a random password based on the prompts indicated. The user will have the option to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters within the password generated based on the length asked by the prompt. The generated password will then display on the screen when successful. Although it being a password generator site, this website can be used to generate randomized characters of a given length for other potential uses.
